# Spender App

https://spender-app.vercel.app/

With this application, you can set your monthly income, track your monthly expenses and see what is your remaining budget.

I build this small application to get familiar with basic concepts from React.
I also used styled-components to try something new than basic css or module styling.
I chose to save data in localStorage.
